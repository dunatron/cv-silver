                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    While studying a Bachelorsâ€™ Degree in Information Technology at the Southern Institute of
                    Technology,
                    I was able to both develop and strengthened my technological skills; now being proficient in HTML,
                    CSS, PHP, SQL, JAVA, Java-Script XML and C#. Since then i have honed my web development skills to
                    fluently use frameworks such as, CakePhp, Laravel, ASP.NET MVC, and Bootstrap for the front-end.
                    Laravel and Bootstrap are my main weapons. Laravel 4 and 5 for the back-end, and Bootstrap 3 for
                    the front-end. For Source control I use Git, in the terminal!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am passionate about technology, particularly when in comes to the web and mobile development
                    fields. I feel
                    the ability to manipulate, and control technology is stimulating and rewarding. My greatest
                    satisfaction
                    comes from creating something that is user friendly and working upto user expectations. I feel that
                    any
                    type of user system should be pleasent to use, and creating such systems has become my passion. My
                    attention to detail, analytical skills, ability to effectively communicate and creativity put
                    me in a good place to be a fronting force in the industry.

                                                    Heath has made a positive start to statistics, gaining all three internal standards.
                                                    He now needs to transfer those results into the external standards, making merit, at least, his
                                                    goal for each standard. He will need to ensure that all skills are practised thoroughly as each
                                                    external standard contains quite different material.

                                                    Following on from last year's pleasing results, Heath began this year in a reasonably focused manner.
                                                    He lost this focus in his subsequent return from Mexico and seemed to be seriously floundering.
                                                    He has since regained a greater sense of purpose and learnt some of the material missed earlier.
                                                    It will be important for him to continue lifting his performance; the last part of the year will bring its own
                                                    distractions. Heath proved his ability last year, I look forward to a repeat this year.

                                                    Heath is well aware that he starts Physics at a disadvantage having not taken the Level 2 course.
                                                    However, I have been impressed with the mature and focused way that he has approached his studies.
                                                    Having not taken the level 2 course has set a challenge for Heath and he seems to thrive off of it.

                                                    the latter part of the year.

                                                    Heath has improved his learning focus over the last term and this has significantly lifted his level of understanding
                                                    in Y12 Chemistry. A final push should see him gain pleasing success in the final exams and set him up for a

                                                    to learn, both by note making and practising most of the exercises set. He is also prepared to contribute
                                                    orally in class and will question when unsure of any work set. This approach to the subject will help
                                                    him gain the grades he is aiming for.

                                                    Heath would have been disappointed with his practise exam results as he is better mathematically
                                                    than these results suggest. He appeared to be revising for the external exams and hopefully he has eliminated

                                                    unfocused start to the year but he has since settled well and is now producing the quality of
                                                    work that he is capable of. His recent grade in 2.7 reflects this. If Heath can stay focused,
                                                    seek clarification in class and reinforce class work with revision in his own time then he should
                                                    be able to gain excellence in the remaining standards. Heath is busy, but he must prioritise his school
                                                    work occasionally.

                                                    in the year since then he has taken ownership of his work and has produced some outstanding assessments.

                                                    Heath made a great start to the year by gaining Excellence for both internal standards, but
                                                    lately I have been worried about the increasing amount of off task behaviour that he is displaying.
                                                    Heath is an able student who is capable of doing well in this subject but he needs to get his priorities in order.
                                                    More focus in class is required plus a commitment to revise regularly. I hope Heath makes the necessary changes
                                                    as I believe he could be very successful in this subject.

                                                    The school exams gave Heath a wake-up call with regards to his efforts in this subject. Heath is a person
                                                    who should be getting much better results in exams but his casual efforts in class and a lack of
                                                    revision were reflected in his school exam results. I am pleased to say that Heath has really put his head down
                                                    since and made an effort to use his time wisely over the last 4 weeks, but if he intends to take Level 3 biology
                                                    next year he needs to realise he must work for it, even if it seems easy!

                                                    develop ideas and learn new materials grows stronger as he successfully completes each assessment.
                                                    Heath's attitude towards achievement and his ability in the theoretical aspect of this course has changed
                                                    hugely. Hard work is Heath's biggest asset at the moment and he needs to hold onto this.
                                                    There is no place for over confidence and complacency as this will destroy all the great work that has been done so far.

                                                    Heath has completed 2006 with a commendable set of grades in Physical Education. I feel
                                                    he lost some momentum in the third term, which was due to a lack of interest in the
                                                    achievement standard we were completing. This is a maturity issue for Heath. He has made
                                                    positive improvements this year and will continue to do so in 2007. The recently completed
                                                    Kiwisport Leadership Award was a high point for Heath. His manner with the younger students
                                                    was outstanding and a real credit to him.

                                                    Heath's achievement so far is not a true indication of what he is capable of.
                                                    He is articulate and able to present evidence to support his answers but too often his
                                                    understanding of basic concepts is shaky. Heath's focus in class is patchy - often he appears
                                                    tired and homework is not always completed. I believe that a step up in effort in the above areas
                                                    would improve Heath's results enormously.

                                                    Heath has achieved to his potential in the two internal assessment tasks where he worked
                                                    well in a very structured environment. His approach was thorough and focused and he was able
                                                    to articulate his ideas clearly. Heaths exam results indicate that he still needs to learn
                                                    basic concepts in some areas and refine his exam technique so that he manages his time more
                                                    effectively in each achievement standard.
